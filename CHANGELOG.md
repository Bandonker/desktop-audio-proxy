  const { audioUrl, isLoading, error, retry } = useAudioProxy(url);
  const { capabilities } = useAudioCapabilities();
  
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <audio controls src={audioUrl} />;
}
```

**Vue Composable Usage:**
```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { useAudioProxy, useAudioCapabilities } from 'desktop-audio-proxy/vue';

const url = ref('https://example.com/audio.mp3');
const { audioUrl, isLoading, error, retry } = useAudioProxy(url);
const { capabilities } = useAudioCapabilities();
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="isLoading">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="error">Error: {{ error }} <button @click="retry">Retry</button></div>
  <audio v-else controls :src="audioUrl" />
</template>
